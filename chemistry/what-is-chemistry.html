                    <p><strong>Sara: </strong>That’s not really what I asked, but go on—I love hearing you talk 😊</p>
                    <p><strong>Marko: </strong>Then listen closely. Chemistry is a wonderful science.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sara: </strong>And what does this wonderful science actually study? I’d love for the
                        object of my admiration to tell me about the object of study in chemistry 😊</p>
                    <p><strong>Marko: </strong>Chemistry studies matter, so we can say that the main focus of chemistry
                        is matter itself.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sara: </strong>And what exactly is matter?</p>
                    <p><strong>Marko: </strong>Matter is anything that takes up space and has mass. There are so many
                        examples that I’m actually struggling to think of something that isn’t made of matter.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sara: </strong>What about love, Marko? Love has no mass and takes up no space, although
                        it feels like butterflies are filling up my stomach right now.</p>
                    <p><strong>Marko: </strong>You’re right. Love is an emotion—it’s not matter. But everything around
                        us, and even we ourselves, are made of matter.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sara: </strong>So you’re saying, for example, that my phone is an object made of
                        different types of matter—like plastic, glass, and metal?</p>
                    <p><strong>Marko: </strong>Exactly. And by the way, there are many types of plastic. I happen to
                        know that your phone is made of a kind of plastic called polycarbonate, and the metal parts are
                        made of aluminum.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sara: </strong>I like how you “just happened” to find out what my phone is made of 😏</p>
                    <p><strong>Marko: </strong>I love knowing everything related to science, Sara.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sara: </strong>You love. That sounds so romantic, Marko.</p>
                    <p><strong>Marko: </strong>Believe it or not, if we explore love scientifically, we’ll end up back
                        in chemistry—there are substances involved in the feeling of being in love.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sara: </strong>So there *is* chemistry between us. I knew it! 😍</p>
