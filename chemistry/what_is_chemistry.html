                <p><strong>Sara: </strong>That's not exactly what I meant, but go on—I like listening to you. :)</p>
                <p><strong>Mark: </strong>Well then, listen up. Chemistry is a fascinating science.</p>
                <p><strong>Sara: </strong>I know every science has something it studies. I’d love for my favorite
                    subject—you—to
                    explain the subject of this one. :)</p>
                <p><strong>Mark: </strong>Chemistry is the study of matter. That’s what it focuses on.</p>
                <p><strong>Sara: </strong>And what exactly is matter?</p>
                <p><strong>Mark: </strong>Matter is anything that takes up space and has mass. Honestly, it’s harder to
                    think of
                    something that isn’t matter than something that is.</p>
                <p><strong>Sara: </strong>But what about love, Mark? Love doesn’t have mass or take up space, even
                    though it sometimes feels like butterflies are taking over my stomach.</p>
                <p><strong>Mark: </strong>You're right. Love is an emotion — it’s not matter. But everything that
                    objects around us are made of, including ourselves, is matter.</p>
